# QRAWK: A Subset of AWK


QRAWK is a subset of the AWK programming language. Planned features are:

- HTML, JSON, YAML, etc parsing
- Network features (I know GAWK has them but whatevs)
- EBNF matching
- PCRE and PCRE2 (headers are already wrapped!)

and so on.

Please view the progress and tell me what you think.
